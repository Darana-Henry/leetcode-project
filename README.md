### Detailed Descriptions

- **Math**: Algorithms based on mathematical principles, such as prime numbers, greatest common divisor (GCD), and more.
- **Basic Programming**: Essential algorithms like sorting, searching, and basic data structures.
- **Bit Manipulation**: Operations on individual bits to solve problems efficiently, often used in optimization.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Techniques for solving complex problems by combining solutions to simpler subproblems. It involves the use of memoization or tabulation.
- **Divide and Conquer / Merge**: Breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each independently, and merging the results. Examples include merge sort and quicksort.
- **Two Pointers**: A technique where two pointers iterate through the data structure to solve problems involving pairs or subarrays.
- **Sliding Window**: A technique to maintain a window of elements and slide it over the data structure to solve subarray problems.
- **Binary Search**: An efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Prefix Sum**: Precomputing cumulative sums to quickly answer range sum queries.
- **Linked List**: A linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, used in problems involving backtracking and recursion.
- **Hash**: A data structure that maps keys to values for efficient lookups. Commonly used in caching and indexing.
- **Trees**: Non-linear data structures with a hierarchical relationship between elements. Used in various applications like parsing expressions, hierarchical data representation, etc.
- **Graphs**: Structures made up of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, used to represent networks, relationships, and paths.
    - **Matrix**: Representing graphs using a two-dimensional array.
    - **BFS**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures by exploring neighbors level by level.
    - **DFS**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Heap / Priority Queue**: Specialized tree-based data structures that allow for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.
